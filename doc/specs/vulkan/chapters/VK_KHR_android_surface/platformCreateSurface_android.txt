// refBegin vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR - Create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object for an Android native window

To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for an Android native window, call:

include::../../api/protos/vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance to associate the surface with.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing parameters
    affecting the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface points to a sname:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.

During the lifetime of a surface created using a particular
code:ANativeWindow handle any attempts to create another surface for the
same code:ANativeWindow and any attempts to connect to the same
code:ANativeWindow through other platform mechanisms will fail.

[NOTE]
.NOTE
====
In particular, only one sname:VkSurfaceKHR can: exist at a time for a given
window.
Similarly, a native window cannot: be used by both a sname:VkSurfaceKHR and
EGLSurface simultaneously.
====

If successful, fname:vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR increments the
code:ANativeWindow's reference count, and fname:vkDestroySurfaceKHR will
decrement it.

On Android, when a swapchain's pname:imageExtent does not match the
surface's pname:currentExtent, the presentable images will be scaled to the
surface's dimensions during presentation.
pname:minImageExtent is [eq]#(1,1)#, and pname:maxImageExtent is the maximum
image size supported by the consumer.
For the system compositor, pname:currentExtent is the window size (i.e. the
consumer's preferred size).

// refBegin VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created Android surface object

The sname:VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]

  * pname:sType 是数据结构的类型。
  * pname:pNext 是 `NULL` 或者一个指向拓展特定的数据结构的指针。
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:window is a pointer to the code:ANativeWindow to associate the
    surface with.

.正确使用
****
  * pname:window must: point to a valid Android code:ANativeWindow.
