=== Mir Platform

// refBegin vkCreateMirSurfaceKHR - Create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object for a Mir window

To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for a Mir window, call:

include::../../api/protos/vkCreateMirSurfaceKHR.txt[]

  * pname:instance is the instance to associate the surface with.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkMirSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing parameters
    affecting the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface points to a sname:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.

include::../../validity/protos/vkCreateMirSurfaceKHR.txt[]

// refBegin VkMirSurfaceCreateInfoKHR - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created Mir surface object

The sname:VkMirSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkMirSurfaceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]

  * pname:sType 是数据结构的类型。
  * pname:pNext 是 `NULL` 或者一个指向拓展特定的数据结构的指针。
  * pname:flags 被保留。
  * pname:connection and pname:surface are pointers to the
    code:MirConnection and code:MirSurface for the window to associate the
    surface with.

.正确使用
****
  * pname:connection must: point to a valid code:MirConnection.
  * pname:surface must: point to a valid code:MirSurface.
****

include::../../validity/structs/VkMirSurfaceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]

On Mir, when a swapchain's pname:imageExtent does not match the surface's
pname:currentExtent, the presentable images will be scaled to the surface's
dimensions during presentation.
pname:minImageExtent is [eq]#(1,1)#, and pname:maxImageExtent is the maximum
supported surface size.
