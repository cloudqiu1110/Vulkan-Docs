// refBegin VkImportMemoryWin32HandleInfoNV - import Win32 memory created on the same physical device

To import memory created on the same physical device but outside of the
current Vulkan instance, add a slink:VkImportMemoryWin32HandleInfoNV
structure to the pname:pNext chain of the slink:VkMemoryAllocateInfo
structure, specifying a handle to and the type of the memory.

The sname:VkImportMemoryWin32HandleInfoNV structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkImportMemoryWin32HandleInfoNV.txt[]

  * pname:sType 是数据结构的类型。
  * pname:pNext 是 `NULL` 或者一个指向拓展特定的数据结构的指针。
  * pname:handleType is 0 or a flag specifying the type of memory handle in
    pname:handle.
    Flags which may: be specified are:

  ** if pname:handleType is
     ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_OPAQUE_WIN32_BIT_NV or
     ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_OPAQUE_WIN32_KMT_BIT_NV, the
     handle is one returned by flink:vkGetMemoryWin32HandleNV or, in the
     case of ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_OPAQUE_WIN32_BIT_NV, one
     duplicated from such a handle using `DuplicateHandle()`.
  ** if pname:handleType is
     ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_D3D11_IMAGE_BIT_NV, the handle is
     a valid NT handle returned by
     `IDXGIResource1::ftext:CreateSharedHandle()`, or a handle duplicated
     from such a handle using `DuplicateHandle()`.
  ** if pname:handleType is
     ename:VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_D3D11_IMAGE_KMT_BIT_NV, the handle
     is one returned by `IDXGIResource::GetSharedHandle()`.
  * pname:handle is a Windows code:HANDLE referring to the memory.

If pname:handleType is 0, this structure is ignored by consumers of the
slink:VkMemoryAllocateInfo structure it is chained from.

.Valid Usage
****
  * pname:handleType must: not have more than one bit set.
  * pname:handle must: be a valid handle to memory, obtained as specified by
    pname:handleType.
