=== Alternate Methods to Signal Fences

Besides submitting a fence to a queue as part of a
<<devsandqueues-submission, queue submission>> command, a fence may: also be
signaled when a particular event occurs on a device or display.

// refBegin vkRegisterDeviceEventEXT Signal a fence when a device event occurs

To create a fence that will be signaled when an event occurs on a device,
call:

include::../../api/protos/vkRegisterDeviceEventEXT.txt[]

  * pname:device is a logical device on which the event may: occur.
  * pname:pDeviceEventInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkDeviceEventInfoEXT structure describing the event of interest to
    the application.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pFence points to a handle in which the resulting fence object is
    returned.

include::../../validity/protos/vkRegisterDeviceEventEXT.txt[]

// refBegin VkDeviceEventInfoEXT Describe a device event to create

sname:VkDeviceEventInfoEXT 类型数据结构定义如下：

include::../../api/structs/VkDeviceEventInfoEXT.txt[]

  * pname:sType 是数据结构的类型。
  * pname:pNext 是 `NULL` 或者一个指向拓展特定的数据结构的指针。
  * pname:device specifies when the fence will be signaled.
    Possible values are:
+
--
// refBegin VkDeviceEventTypeEXT Events that can occur on a device object
include::../../api/enums/VkDeviceEventTypeEXT.txt[]
--
+
  ** ename:VK_DEVICE_EVENT_TYPE_DISPLAY_HOTPLUG_EXT occurs when a display is
     plugged into or unplugged from the specified device.
     Applications can: use this notification to determine when they need to
     re-enumerate the available displays on a device.

// refBegin vkRegisterDisplayEventEXT Signal a fence when a display event occurs

To create a fence that will be signaled when an event occurs on a
VkDisplayKHR object, call:

include::../../api/protos/vkRegisterDisplayEventEXT.txt[]

  * pname:device is a logical device associated with pname:display
  * pname:display is the display on which the event may: occur.
  * pname:pDisplayEventInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkDisplayEventInfoEXT structure describing the event of interest
    to the application.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pFence points to a handle in which the resulting fence object is
    returned.

  * pname:sType 是数据结构的类型。
  * pname:pNext 是 `NULL` 或者一个指向拓展特定的数据结构的指针。
  * pname:displayEvent specifies when the fence will be signaled.

--
+
  ** ename:VK_DISPLAY_EVENT_TYPE_FIRST_PIXEL_OUT_EXT occurs when the first
     pixel of the next display refresh cycle leaves the display engine for
     the display.
