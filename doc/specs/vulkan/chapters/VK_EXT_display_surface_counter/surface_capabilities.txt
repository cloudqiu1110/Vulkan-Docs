// refBegin vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2EXT Query surface capabilities

To query the basic capabilities of a surface, needed in order to create a
swapchain, call:

include::../../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2EXT.txt[]

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device that will be associated with
    the swapchain to be created, as described for
    flink:vkCreateSwapchainKHR.
  * pname:surface is the surface that will be associated with the swapchain.
  * pname:pSurfaceCapabilities is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkSurfaceCapabilities2EXT structure in which the capabilities are
    returned.

fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2EXT behaves similarly to
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR, with the ability to return
extended information via chained output structures.

// refBegin VkSurfaceCapabilities2EXT Structure describing capabilities of a surface

The sname:VkSurfaceCapabilities2EXT structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkSurfaceCapabilities2EXT.txt[]

All members of sname:VkSurfaceCapabilities2EXT are identical to the
corresponding members of slink:VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR where one exists.
The remaining members are:

  * pname:sType 是数据结构的类型。
  * pname:pNext 是 `NULL` 或者一个指向拓展特定的数据结构的指针。
  * pname:supportedSurfaceCounters is a bitfield containing one bit set for
    each surface counter type supported.

.正确使用
****
  * pname:supportedSurfaceCounters must: not include
    ename:VK_SURFACE_COUNTER_VBLANK_EXT unless the surface queried is a
    <<wsi-display-surfaces,display surface>>.

// refBegin VkSurfaceCounterFlagBitsEXT Surface-relative counter types

Valid values for
slink:VkSurfaceCapabilities2EXT::pname:supportedSurfaceCounters are defined
by sname:VkSurfaceCounterFlagBitsEXT as follows:

include::../../api/enums/VkSurfaceCounterFlagBitsEXT.txt[]

  * ename:VK_SURFACE_COUNTER_VBLANK_EXT A counter incrementing once every
    time a vblank period occurs on the display associated with the surface.
